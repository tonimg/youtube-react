# React example app

This project was bootstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Is a simple project for demo purposes based on [one](https://github.com/fmaylinch/youtube-react) that showed [Ferran Maylinch](https://github.com/fmaylinch) at the Mini Bootcamp in React. js (by World Tech Makers). I have tried to improve it following the patterns defined by Facebook for [managing events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) on React.

## First steps for using create-react-app

1. Install node from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
2. Install [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app): `npm install --global create-react-app`.
3. You may use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to install local node packages: `npm install --global yarn`.  Then you could do `yarn add PACKAGE` instead of `npm install --save PACKAGE`.
4. Execute `create-react-app PROJECT_NAME`. Then you can enter `cd PROJECT_NAME` and execute `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the app.
